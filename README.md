Quiz Game in C

– Project Introduction:
- I have divided this project into many functions, and listed below are some of those which may help you understand the project better.

1. edit_score() – adds the current cash prize won to the previous one upon giving the right answer to a question
2. help() – help menu with game summary and rules
3. reset_score() – to reset the highest score/cash prize to default
4. show_record() – shows the highest cash prize won by a particular user
5. show_score() – to view the highest score

- In this quiz game, you can store the user name, view the highest score secured by a user, and even reset the score.
  Additionally, to make the game look a little more interesting, it is divided into two rounds; user must pass the first round to reach the second one.
- In the 2 rounds as I mentioned above, the first is called the Warm-up Round; the second is the Challenge round. In the warm-up round,
  the user is asked a total of three simple questions and they must be able to answer at least two of them correctly to enter the next round.
  
- If the user is not capable of doing that, he is not permitted to proceed further.

- The user will be asked questions continuously, and for each right answer given, they will earn ₹1,00,000 For each question asked,
  there are 4 options, namely A, B, C and D. There are no negative markings, so the user’s accumulated cash money won’t be deducted for wrong answers to the questions.
